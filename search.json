    "text": "FAQ\n\nQuizzes\n\nWhat happens if I miss a quiz due to any reason?\n\nThe quiz will be marked as 0.\nThe provision of best 6 out of 8 quizzes is designed keeping in mind such scenarios.\n\nWill the quizzes and end-semester exam be open book? Will I be allowed to carry notes?\n\nNo, the exams and quizzes will be closed book. You are not permitted to carry notes.\n\nHow soon can I expect to receive my answer sheets back?\n\nYou should expect to receive answer sheets back in 4-5 working days.\n\nIs there an end-semester exam or mid-semester exam?\n\nNo, there is no end-semester exam or mid-semester exam. However, some of the quizzes may be held in the exam slot. In total we will have 8 equal weightage quizzes. The best 6 out of them will be considered for the final grade.\n\nWill the quizzes be MCQs or subjective?\n\nThe quizzes may contain both the MCQs and subjective questions.\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\n\nWhat happens if I miss an assignment due to any reason?\n\nThere will no extensions for assignments.\n\nI have a doubt in the assignment. Whom should I write to?\n\nAsk on the slack General channel. If you don’t get a response within 2 days, write to the course instructor.\n\nI do not know Python. Can I code assignments in some other language?\n\nUnfortunately, no. You have to stick to Python.\n\nHow will you evaluate the assignment?\n\nThe assignments would be followed by a viva. The TAs would first check the code and compare against the submission. Any change from the submitted code is not allowed and any instance of the same would culminate in a warning. The TAs would run the code and ask a few questions. About 75% of these questions would be based on the assignment in question and about 25% would be based on the theory behind the concepts covered in the assignment.\nThe grade breakup would be: i) code runs correctly and solves the problem [50% marks]; ii) questions based on the assignment and student understanding of code [25% marks]; iii) code quality [12.5% marks]; iv) questions based on the theory behind the concepts covered in the assignments [12.5% marks]\n\nIs the assignment individual or group?\n\nThe assignment is TBA. In case of group, all team members get the same grade for the assignment.\n\n\n\n\nAttendance\n\nAttendance policy\n\nAttendance is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. Marks often correlated with attendance.\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\nIs there a project component in the course?\n\nNo. There is no project component in the course.\n\n\n\n\nBonus\n\nCan I choose a PR of my choice.\n\nYes, you can choose a PR of your choice from a list of PRs decided by the teaching staff. The teaching staff hold the right to decide whether a PR is suitable or not."
